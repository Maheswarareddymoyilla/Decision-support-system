About Tableau:

Tableau is a software used for data visualization and for data analysis.

Groupon is about e-commerce company which is mainly about deals. It needs to maintain a large amount of data. Preparing the data to share between all the employees is difficult.
By using Tableau, they overcame above problems and created a very pleasing and creative layouts which represents the overall information about the customer satisfaction and their reviews. They also reduced the time in generating the reports. It also helps them in analyzing the customer and the information about what the customer is experiencing.

GitHub is a place where we can create some repositories to add the code, from which many users can access to the code and update and can be used as for deployment for ease.
Repository that I have explored is 
https://github.com/NaveenVupputuri/CMPS-Cryptography-Naveen. 
The repository is of about cryptography, in which they about cipher algorithms. The people in a team created each repository of their own to access the code and for deployment purposes. They created sub-level codes which are inherited from the main branch, which they can execute at a single go without any problems. They mainly used GitHub for deployment purposes and for easy sharing of code between the team.
